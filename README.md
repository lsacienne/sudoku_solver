# Sudoku Solver

This program try to achieve the solving of any Sudoku.

## Basics

Before starting to code anything, I started by thinking about "how could I model sudoku ?".

To answer this, I remembered my courses at university talking about [Constraint Satsifaction Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) or CSP. I quickly guessed that this particular approach was the best way to solve a Sudoku.

In order to solve a CSP, you need to have 3 elements in your problems :

- **Variables** : They corresponds to the elements taht should be positioned.
- **Domains of the variables** : The values that our variables can take
- **Constraints** : The constraints that our variables must respect.

To model this problem, I tried to figure out which elements needed to be considered.

### Variables considered

I did not know really what to consider. Should I consider numbers, lines, columns or something else ?

I chose to consider directly cells with some metadata :

- Value : to compare the values inside a cell.
- Line : to know if the number is in a particular line.
- Column : to know if the number is in particular column.
- Square : to know if the number is in a particular square.

To simplify the notations, one uses some acronyms :

- **C_XY** : is a cell indexed XY (07 by example)
- **L(C_XY)** : is the line of the cell
- **C(C_XY)** : is the column of the cell
- **S(C_XY)** : is the squared of the cell
- **V(C_XY)** : is the value inside of the cell

To give a unique identifier for each cell, I chose to name it according to a left-right, top-bottom numeration.

</p>

### Variables domains

The variables are **L(C_XY)**, **C(C_XY)**, **S(C_XY)** & **V(C_XY)**.

Their respective domains are :

- **L(C_XY)** : *{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}*
- **C(C_XY)** : *{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}*
- **S(C_XY)** : *{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}*
- **V(C_XY)** : *{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}*

### Constraints

Finally, the key part of this analysis : the constraints.

They directly come from the rules of the sudoku game :

- **Line Constraint** : {L(C_XY) = L(C_ZW); V(C_XY) != V(C_ZW)}
- **Column Constraint** : {C(C_XY) = C(C_ZW); V(C_XY) != V(C_ZW)}
- **Square Constraint** : {S(C_XY) = S(C_ZW); V(C_XY) != V(C_ZW)}

## Strategy

To solve this problem I chose to use the most basic AI algorithm existing for solving CSP : **[Generate & Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search)**.

This approach is pretty barbaric without the use of some heuristic but it can become really good if one choose to not generate every possible case!

I chose to implement an algorithm that look like [this one by Christine SOLNON](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/christine.solnon/Site-PPC/session3/e-miage-ppc-sess3.htm#va_voir_1) (in french) :

```
function generateAndTest(A,(X,D,C)) : return boolean

Precondition :
(X,D,C) = A CSP on the finite domains
A = a partial allocation for (X,D,C)

Post-relationship :
return true if the partial allocation A can be extended in one solution for (X,D,C), false otherwise

Begin
  If every variable from X are allocated to a value in A Then :    /* A is a total allocation */
    If A is consistent Then
      /* A is a solution */
      return True
    Else
      return False
    EndIf
  Else                                                             /* A is a partial allocation */
    choose a variable Xi of X which is not yet allocated to a value in A
    For every value Vi that belongs to D(Xi) Do
      If generateAndTest(A âˆª {(Xi,Vi)}, (X,D,C)) = True Then
        return True
      EndIf
    EndFor
    return False
  EndIf
End
```

I modified it a bit during the implementation to optimize it and not have a "super dumb" algorithm.
